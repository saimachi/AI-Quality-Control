# AI-Quality-Control

This dataset was provided by Frito-Lay, the subidiary of Pepsico, in an effort to improve their chip quality control through a Kaggle competition two years ago. We decided to tackle this challenge to sharpen our deep learning and computer vision skills. During the chip-making process, some of the chips get burnt, and there is a maximum amount of damage for a chip to be passable. Therefore, acting like PepsiCo interns, we built a deep learning model to solve this problem.
